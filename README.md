  This is very small, tiny Modbus RTU Slave library for small microcontrollers. It supports Modbus 3-6 and 16 functions!
  Easy to use, easy to port! Examples with PIC and ARM Microcontrollers!  
 
  It's free to use with non-commercial projects.            
  Of course you can not blame me after your project died when using my codes wrong :)                              

  For support please give feedback for it!
